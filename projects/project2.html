    <h2> CNC ROUTER</h2>
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/duqi6hkh0/image/upload/v1716816809/router/o27rgfgam64uweqnsiry.jpg" style="width:100%">

    <p>The goal of this project was to design and build a CNC router for the purpose of manufacturing parts
        for underprivelidged West Australian Highschool robotics teams (learn more about that <a href="../html/frc.html" style="color:blue;text-decoration: underline;">Here</a>) who
    do not have access to a CNC router.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3> Specification</h3>
    <p>
       With these goals in mind, here is an abbreviated list of criteria for the project to fulfill:
       <ul>
        <li>Budget of ~$1000</li>
        <li>Capable of machining 6061 aluminium at a material-removal rate of 100mm^3/s (A typical low-cost router does half that and with worse quality)</li>
        <li>Accurate to within +/- 0.2..</li>
        <li>Work profile of 400x800x100 to accomodate most FRC parts</li>
        <li>Fits on a desktop and in the back of a Ute</li>
        <li>Automatic homing and computer spindle control</li>
        <li>Homing accuracy of +/- 0.2mm</li>
        <li>Interlocked polycarbonate enclosure</li>
        <li>Electrical cabinet is not a fire hazard</li>
       </ul>
       For a more in-depth look at the pre-design stage, check out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRvYMsuwfOiN7RmpWN2L0cvKhZFn9wHWp_-NWDcOeJGZ4_jmx8uSNLrugOxywSqdz8M5HyloREM1CMn/pub" style="color:blue;text-decoration: underline;">Google Document</a>
       for this project.

    <h3>Mechanical Design</h3>

    <p> The machine was built around a large HDPE billet<br> from a surplus plastics store. A local machine <br> shop kindly
        let us use their large wood router  <br>and drill press to manufacture this part. On top of<br> this sat cheap SBR20 linear rails, on which the <br> gantry is able to move along the Y axis.<br><br>
        The gantry itself was constructed out of 25x150mm <br>aluminium flats, with numerous holes drilled along <br>the surface for components to mount to.
        The<br> zigzag blind hole pattern on the butt ends of the <br>flats required some jigs, a hydralic jack trolley <br> and some prayers to get right.

    <h3> Electrical Cabinet</h3>
    <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/duqi6hkh0/image/upload/v1716816808/router/wzm4ssbdm9kc3lgctuqz.jpg" style="width:100%">
    <p>
        An old modified eATX desktop case is used to house the electronics, including:
        <ul>
            <li>Master isolator switch and 10A RCBO on input</li>
            <li>24V 360W PSU for DRIVE motors</li>
            <li>240V contactor used to cut DRIVE power when E-STOP is pressed</li>
            <li>TB-6600 Stepper drivers for NEMA-23 motors</li>
            <li>12V PSU for main control board</li>
            <li>Custom ESP32-based controller PCB (see below)</li>
            <li>240V 1.5kw 3-phase VFD for main spindle motor</li>
            <li>E-STOP and other control buttons and indicators</li>
            <li> DIN rails to mount standard components on</li>
        </ul>

        As Mentioned, a custom PCB with an embedded ESP32 is used as the router's brain. It runs a version of
        <a href="https://github.com/bdring/FluidNC" style="color:blue;text-decoration: underline;">FluidNC</a> that was modified to
        match the hardware setup. The ESP32 is able to connect to a network with a browser-based web UI, meaning
        any computer can be used to wirelessly send G-Code to the machine.

    <h3> Project Outcome</h3>
    <p>
        So far, we have been able to acheive an MRR of 200mm^2/s, <b>double</b> our specified goal!
        The most time consuming part of the operation is fixing a workpiece and tool changing (perhaps an ATC is on the horizon).
        We have also surpassed our desired tolerance goal, hitting +/-0.1mm after the lead screws have been adjusted.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, the project was a major success. Following completion in February of 2024, The router has already spent hundreds of
        hours producing parts for several robotics teams around WA, with many more to come. The lessons learnt designing, manufacturing
        and operation the machine will be invaluable to My future endeavors.
    </p>
    <p> If you would like more information, I have
        created a google document detailing the entire design, manufacturing and issues that arose during construction, linked <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRvYMsuwfOiN7RmpWN2L0cvKhZFn9wHWp_-NWDcOeJGZ4_jmx8uSNLrugOxywSqdz8M5HyloREM1CMn/pub" style="color:blue;text-decoration: underline;">Here</a>.
